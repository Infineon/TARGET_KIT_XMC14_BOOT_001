# KIT_XMC14_BOOT_001 BSP Release Notes
The XMC1400 Boot Kit (CPU-14A-V1) houses the XMC1400 Microcontroller and a 2x30 pin edge for application expansion.     
**Note:**
Programming this kit requires installing 
[SEGGER J-Link software](https://www.segger.com/downloads/jlink/#J-LinkSoftwareAndDocumentationPack)

NOTE: BSPs are versioned by family. This means that version 1.2.0 of any BSP in a family (eg: PSoC™ 6) will have the same software maturity level. However, not all updates are necessarily applicable for each BSP in the family so not all version numbers will exist for each board. Additionally, new BSPs may not start at version 1.0.0. In the event of adding a common feature across all BSPs, the libraries are assigned the same version number. For example if BSP_A is at v1.3.0 and BSP_B is at v1.2.0, the event will trigger a version update to v1.4.0 for both BSP_A and BSP_B. This allows the common feature to be tracked in a consistent way.

### What's Included?
The KIT_XMC14_BOOT_001 library includes the following:
* BSP specific makefile to configure the build process for the board
* cybsp.c/h files to initialize the board and any system peripherals
